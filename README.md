# employee-tracker

## About This Project

### Employee-Tracker utilizes a combination of MySQL and Node.js that prompts the user with a series of questions regarding which use cases they would like to adopt from the system. This program allows the user to view data (outputted as a table) from a company's departments, their employees, roles, and associated ID's. 

## How To Use

### Run your MySQL files using the source command, install/require MySQL2 & Inquirer, and simply call the command using the node index.js command inside the terminal. From there, follow the prompts accordingly and input data when necessary. Scroll up through the terminal to view the outputted data.
